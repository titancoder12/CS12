### Ways to model mathematical problems
- estimate theoretical probability through simulation
- represent finite sequences and series
- solve a system of linear equations, exponential growth/decay
- solve a polynomial equation
- calculate statistical values such as frequency, central tendencies, standard deviation of large data set
- compute greatest common factor/least common multiples
