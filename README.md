Christopher Lin's work for [BC Curriculum - Computer Science 12](https://curriculum.gov.bc.ca/curriculum/mathematics/12/computer-science).

The materials are selected from: 
- Harvard University's [CS50 - Introduction to the intellectual enterprises of computer science and the art of programming](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2023/)
- Harvard University's [CS50AI - Introduction to Artificial Intelligence with Python](https://cs50.harvard.edu/ai/2023/)

### 1. Access variables in memory
- pass by value versus by reference, or mutable/immutable data types

### 3. Ways in which data structures are organized in memory
- vectors, lists, queues, dictionaries, maps, trees, stacks

### 2. Uses of multidimensional arrays
- board games, image manipulation, representing tabular data or matrices

### 4. Classical algorithms, including sorting and searching
- sorting (e.g., bubble, insertion, selection, quick merge)
- searching (e.g., binary search, data structure traversal)


### 5. Use of Big-O notation to help predict run-time performance
- analyzing algorithms to predict and compare run-time complexity
- working with large data sets

### 6. Recursive problem solving
- recognizing recursive problems or patterns
- Fibonacci sequence, exponents, factorials, palindromes, combinations, greatest common factor, fractals

### 7. Persistent memory
-  read from/write to a file
  
### 8. Encapsulation
- creating your own data type, class, or structure as well as public, private, static/class variables

### 9. Ways to model mathematical problems
- estimate theoretical probability through simulation
- represent finite sequences and series
- solve a system of linear equations, exponential growth/decay
- solve a polynomial equation
- calculate statistical values such as frequency, central tendencies, standard deviation of large data set
- compute greatest common factor/least common multiples
